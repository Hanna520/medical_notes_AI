Objectives:

This study aims to explore the model performance of various machine learning algorithms (CNN, Transformer Encoder, BERT-Base, RNN, GRU, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM) in 16 text classification tasks on medical notes with respect to different disease class imbalance scenarios. 

Data:

The data used in this study were derived from datasets on https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/. Although the data are de-identified and publicly available, authorization is required to download the datasets from this website. The data is consisted of 1,237 discharge summary notes that were annotated with 16 disease conditions (Gout, OSA, Gallstones, Hypertriglyceridemia, Depression, Diabetes, Asthma, OA, PVD, CAD, Obesity, Hypertension, Venous, Hypercholesterolemia, GERD, CHF). 

How to run the code:

1. Go to https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/ and following the instructions to download the datasets used in Part I of the code
2. Download all packages required in the code
3. Make sure your current working directory is the same as in the code
4. Run the code
5. Run the R files to create model performance graphs
